Quantum AI leverages quantum bits (qubits) to solve complex optimization problems exponentially faster than classical methods.  
**Industries Benefiting:** Drug discovery, finance, logistics, and cryptography.

### ✅ Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare
AI supports human professionals rather than replacing them.  
**Impact:** Radiologists may use AI to detect anomalies faster; nurses can monitor patient vitals with predictive alerts.

### ✅ Case Study: AI-IoT in Smart Cities
**Analysis:** AI+IoT improves urban sustainability by optimizing traffic flow, reducing emissions, and supporting data-driven decisions.
